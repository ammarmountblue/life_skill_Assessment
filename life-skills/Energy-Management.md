# Energy Management

## 1. Manage Energy, Not Time

The idea is to stay mostly in the Excitement, Calm, and Healthy Stress quadrants.  
Stress is normal and helps us grow, but staying stressed too long causes burnout.  
So the goal is to **feel the stress, finish the task, and then move to calm activities** for recovery.

Understanding yourself is the most important part.
